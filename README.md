ðŸ’« Importance

This project will help the user to find solutions to various arithmetic functions. In this calculator, the user will be able to select the required function, input the question and get the desired output as a stepwise solution. With help of this project, the user will have access to various arithmetic functions in one place itself without any need to search elsewhere individually for each function.

ðŸ’« Methodology

The user will be requested to select the preferred arithmetic function, input the values and hence a stepwise solution will be displayed as the output on the userâ€™s screen.
We are going to use the C language as the main programming tool for the calculations along with the help of the GUI software to create the familiar calculator interface.

The arithmetic functions available for the user are: - 
1.	The area of various 2D and 3D shapes
2.	The volume of various 3D shapes
3.	Summation of various series
4.	Find Mean
